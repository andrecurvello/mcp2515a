mcp2515a
========

new implementation of the mcp251x driver with low latency/low IRQ in mind making use of asyncronous SPI

# note:
with the new spi-bcm2835 driver with everything optimized place this becomes "almost" redundant.
There are still things to improve on, but that possibly can get done on the mcp251x driver itself
